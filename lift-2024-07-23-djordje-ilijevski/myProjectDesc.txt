Creates different loan types:
Each loan  type must have a unique name.
Loan types number is not limited/defined in advance.


TABLE - loan_type
id
name - UNIQUE


Example of loan type short names:
public enum LoanType {

}




Examples of loan types:
Cash loan

The procedure consists of a list of arbitrarily defined steps.

LoanType = CASH has 2 steps:
Collection of required documents
Salary verification


	LoanType = REAL_ESTATE has 4 steps:
validation of the client's creditworthiness,
real estate insurance
Documents
Salary
etc.


Each step must have: TABLE
name,
order number,
expected duration in days.
TABLE - loan_type_step
id
name
order_number
noOfDays 		- expected duration in days
fk loan_type_id - foreign key - reference to loan_type table


IMPORTANT:
A single step can only be associated with one loan type.
